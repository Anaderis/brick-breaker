# brick-breaker
As part of my algorithm course at CESI Brest, I created a brick breaker game inspired by Hearthstone and World of warcraft. 
I did it from scratch but the functions using SDL were provided (keyPressed, joyButtonpressed for instance).
Please find below 2 videos that introduce my game (both if you win or lose).
